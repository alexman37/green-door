	LENA(look-away):I've always felt like I didn't fit in with other people...
	LENA(look-away-2):Like I don't deserve them.
	LENA(pensive):Just coming here took years of convincing myself that I needed to.
	LENA(pensive-2):That I wouldn't be wasting everyone's time.
	
	RED(writing-lookup)[2]:I'm sorry you feel that way.
	LENA(glance):The thing is, I don't know where or when those feelings started...
	LENA(nervous):But I know how they got worse.

	# Pause

	RED(writing1)[3]:The garden?
	LENA(sigh):There was just something about it.
	LENA(default):I knew I was the only one there, and...I was totally fine with it.
	LENA(glance):People didn't need me for anything. And, I know this sounds bad, but...
	LENA(crossed-2)[2]:I didn't need them.
	LENA(crossed):I had everything I wanted in that garden.

	# Pause

	RED(writing2)[4]:What about your friends and family? They must have missed you when you were gone.
	LENA(antsy)[2]:...
	RED(writing-lookup-concerned):Lena?
	LENA(defeated):No one missed me.
	LENA(distraught):No one misses me right now.
	RED(normal-talking):I'm sorry, but that isn't-
	LENA(antsy-2):It IS true!
	LENA(antsy):I...

	# Pauses

	LENA(pensive)[3]:I'm sorry...I'm sorry.
	LENA(pensive-2):I shouldn't have said that.

	# Pause

	LENA(glance)[3]:I've just...I've never been good at understanding other people.
	LENA(weak-smile):Ha, it's actually kind of ironic.

	# Pause

	LENA(look-away)[3]:Everyone who's happy seems to have friends.
	LENA(default):I always thought I needed them...
	LENA(talking):But the longer I went on without them, I wondered if it was possible to live a happy life all by yourself.
	LENA(bothered):The garden told me that I could.

	# Pause

	LENA(nervous)[3]:Is it really okay to do that?

# Two choices:Solitude is a virtue // Friends are what life is for
# [Solitude]

/BLOCK=solitude
	RED(folded-hands):What you are describing is a human behavior that resulted from centuries of evolution.
	LENA(bothered):...?
	RED(adjust-glasses):Bear with me for a moment.

	# Pause

	RED(grumpy2)[2]:In ancient times, survival was difficult.
	RED(grumpy):Human beings aren't particularly strong, durable, or resilient creatures.
	RED(folded-hands-2):Not enough to last long, alone in the wild.
	RED(folded-hands):We stood a better chance if we stuck together.

	# Pause

	RED(default)[2]:Of course, there were exceptions. Some were outsiders, not suitable for a tribe.
	RED(normal-talking):Sometimes, it wasn't their own fault.
	RED(default):Regardless...those who could socialize protected each other, and lived on through future generations.
	RED(grumpy2):The outsiders died long ago.

	# Pause

	RED(looking-off-talking)[2]:Humanity's fortunes have changed since those times.
	RED(looking-off):Our society is only in its advanced stage because of centuries of cooperation.
	RED(default):We rely on thousands of people, whose names and actions we quickly forget.
	RED(normal-talking):We are, still, not surviving alone.
	RED(pensive):But we can certainly feel that way.

	# Pause

	RED(folded-hands-2)[2]:The lack of socialization sparks some deeper fear within us...a remainder of our distant past.
	RED(folded-hands):It's not unlike our fear of the dark, or thunderstorms.
	RED(default):It is possible to grow out of this fear.
	RED(normal-talking):I would know.

	# Pause

	LENA(happy)[2]:Then...the garden really is all I need?
	RED(normal-talking):For you, it represents true freedom.
	RED(default):Freedom from a society that you feel outside of.
	RED(default):Freedom from earthly responsibility.
	RED(looking-off-talking):We are all searching for our gardens.
	RED(smiling)[2]:I sincerely believe, one way or another, you will find yours.

# [Friends]

/BLOCK=friends
	RED(folded-hands-2):Typically, I don't like bringing up other patients. But here, it feels practical.
	RED(folded-hands):Many before you have sat in that same chair and expressed something similar.
	RED(folded-hands):Many were your age.
	RED(grumpy2):It is hard to make friends...
	RED(normal-talking):But it is an essential part of the human experience.

	# Pause

	LENA(nervous)[2]:You get what I'm saying though, right?
	LENA(talking):This feeling of loneliness...like I have no place in society. It's always been with me.
	LENA(glance):And then...when I found that garden...
	LENA(glance-2):I felt validated. Like I didn't need them, either.
	LENA(antsy):I just want to go back to that...
	RED(pensive):I know you do.

	# Pause

	RED(folded-hands-2)[4]:You said that you found the garden in this town?
	LENA(crossed-2):It was behind a green door...but that's all I can remember.
	LENA(look-away):Like I said, I was a little kid. I wasn't really paying attention.
	RED(folded-hands):And you've searched every street trying to find it?
	LENA(look-away-2):Countless times...

	# Pause

	RED(looking-off)[4]:Perhaps you should expand your search.
	LENA(antsy-2):Huh?
	RED(looking-off-talking):It's a big town, but the world is bigger.
	RED(looking-off):You have many years left to keep looking.
	LENA(bothered)[2]:You're saying I should give up on the garden.
	RED(normal-talking):I think there's more things out there worth finding.
	RED(default):And, especially, I don't want you to give up on humanity as a whole.
	RED(grumpy2):Many of us feel that we don't match society's expectations.
	RED(normal-talking):But society is not a monolith.
	RED(grumpy):Somewhere out there, someone feels all the same things you do.
	RED(grumpy):Someone understands you.
	RED(default):They might be closer than you think.

	# Pause

	LENA(sigh)[2]:I hope so...
