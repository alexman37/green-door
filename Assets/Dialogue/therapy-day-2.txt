	LENA(): I've always felt like I didn't fit in with other people...
	LENA(): Like I don't deserve them.
	LENA(): Just coming here took years of convincing myself that I needed to.
	LENA(): That I wouldn't be wasting everyone's time.
	
	RED()[2]: I'm sorry you feel that way.
	LENA(): The thing is, I don't know where or when those feelings started...
	LENA(): But I know how they got worse.

	# Pause

	RED()[3]: The garden?
	LENA(): There was just something about it.
	LENA(): I knew I was the only one there, and...I was totally fine with it.
	LENA(): People didn't need me for anything. And, I know this sounds bad, but...
	LENA()[2]: I didn't need them.
	LENA(): I had everything I wanted in that garden.

	# Pause

	RED()[4]: What about your friends and family? They must have missed you when you were gone.
	LENA()[2]: ...
	RED(): Lena?
	LENA(): No one missed me.
	LENA(): No one misses me right now.
	RED(): I'm sorry, but that isn't-
	LENA(): It IS true!
	LENA(): I...

	# Pauses

	LENA()[3]: I'm sorry...I'm sorry.
	LENA(): I shouldn't have said that.

	# Pause

	LENA()[3]: I've just...I've never been good at understanding other people.
	LENA(): Ha, it's actually kind of ironic.

	# Pause

	LENA()[3]: Everyone who's happy seems to have friends.
	LENA(): I always thought I needed them...
	LENA(): But the longer I went on without them, I wondered if it was possible to live a happy life all by yourself.
	LENA(): The garden told me that I could.

	# Pause

	LENA()[3]: Is it really okay to do that?

/BLOCK=solitude
	RED(): What you are describing is a human behavior that resulted from centuries of evolution.
	LENA(): ...?
	RED(): Bear with me for a moment.

	# Pause

	RED()[2]: In ancient times, survival was difficult.
	RED(): Human beings aren't particularly strong, durable, or resilient creatures.
	RED(): Not enough to last long, alone in the wild.
	RED(): We stood a better chance if we stuck together.

	# Pause

	RED()[2]: Of course, there were exceptions. Some were outsiders, not suitable for a tribe.
	RED(): Sometimes, it wasn't their own fault.
	RED(): Regardless...those who could socialize protected each other, and lived on through future generations.
	RED(): The outsiders died long ago.

	# Pause

	RED()[2]: Humanity's fortunes have changed since those times.
	RED(): Our society is only in its advanced stage because of centuries of cooperation.
	RED(): We rely on thousands of people, whose names and actions we quickly forget.
	RED(): We are, still, not surviving alone.
	RED(): But we can certainly feel that way.

	# Pause

	RED()[2]: The lack of socialization sparks some deeper fear within us...a remainder of our distant past.
	RED(): It's not unlike our fear of the dark, or thunderstorms.
	RED(): It is possible to grow out of this fear.
	RED(): I would know.

	# Pause

	LENA()[2]: Then...the garden really is all I need?
	RED(): For you, it represents true freedom.
	RED(): Freedom from a society that you feel outside of.
	RED(): Freedom from earthly responsibility.
	RED(): We are all searching for our gardens.
	RED()[2]: I sincerely believe, one way or another, you will find yours.

	RED(): Typically, I don't like bringing up other patients. But here, it feels practical.
	RED(): Many before you have sat in that same chair and expressed something similar.
	RED(): Many were your age.
	RED(): It is hard to make friends...
	RED(): But it is an essential part of the human experience.

	# Pause

	LENA()[2]: You get what I'm saying though, right?
	LENA(): This feeling of loneliness...like I have no place in society. It's always been with me.
	LENA(): And then...when I found that garden...
	LENA(): I felt validated. Like I didn't need them, either.
	LENA(): I just want to go back to that...
	RED(): I know you do.

	# Pause

	RED()[4]: You said that you found the garden in this town?
	LENA(): It was behind a green door...but that's all I can remember.
	LENA(): Like I said, I was a little kid. I wasn't really paying attention.
	RED(): And you've searched every street trying to find it?
	LENA(): Countless times...

	# Pause

	RED()[4]: Perhaps you should expand your search.
	LENA(): Huh?
	RED(): It's a big town, but the world is bigger.
	RED(): You have many years left to keep looking.
	LENA()[2]: You're saying I should give up on the garden.
	RED(): I think there's more things out there worth finding.
	RED(): And, especially, I don't want you to give up on humanity as a whole.
	RED(): Many of us feel that we don't match society's expectations.
	RED(): But society is not a monolith.
	RED(): Somewhere out there, someone feels all the same things you do.
	RED(): Someone understands you.
	RED(): They might be closer than you think.

	# Pause

	LENA()[2]: I hope so...
