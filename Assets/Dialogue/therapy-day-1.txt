	N():I was young.
	N():I can't remember how I found it.\nI guess, really, it found me.
	N():One day, I was wandering around town...\nDidn't know where I was going.\nDidn't want to know.
	N():I must have been looking for adventure.\nOr an escape.
	N():Suddenly, there it was.

	N():An immaculate green door, adorned with lush leaves and white roses.
	N():It was out of place in a town like this. It didn't belong.
	N():...I knew it was special.

	N():There was another world inside. A better world.
	N():A beautiful, serene garden...as pristine as you can imagine.
	N():A place where the setting sun always shines...
	N():Where the warm breeze puts your mind at ease...
	N():Where the golden plains and the gentle hills go on, and on, and on...
	N():The place of my dreams.
	N():I could have stayed there forever.

	LENA()[2]:That's what bothers me.

	# Pause

	RED():Why does it bother you?
	LENA():I haven't been back since.
	LENA():I've tried looking for it.\nBy now, I must've searched every street in this town.
	LENA():And I'm still searching...

	# Pause

	RED()[2]:Why is it important that you find the garden again?
	LENA():...
	LENA():You don't believe me.
	RED():That's not what I meant.
	LENA():No, I get it.\nI wouldn't believe me, either.
	LENA():This is all just...ridiculous, you know?

	# Pauses

	RED()[2]:Whether the garden is real or not, the experience has impacted you in some way.
	RED():You were willing to tell this story, knowing I likely wouldn't believe it.
	RED():That must mean something.

	# Pauses

	LENA()[3]:I've always had a hard time fitting in.
	LENA():Everything moves so fast.\nThere's always so much to do, in so little time.
	LENA():But in that field, surrounded by endless nature...
	LENA():I felt like I had all the time in the world.

	# Pauses

	LENA()[3]:What do you make of that?
	RED():You're asking me for a diagnosis?
	LENA():I guess so.
	RED():I'm simply here to talk you through your feelings.
	RED():Only you can answer that question.\nIt would be unprofessional for me to judge you-
	LENA():I'll allow it.
	RED():...

	LENA()[2]:Please...

	RED():It sounds like a wonderful place.
	LENA():It was.
	LENA():I dream about it every night...

	# Pause

	LENA()[1]:Then I wake up here.

	# Pause

	RED()[3]:Whether the garden is real or not...
	RED():Whether you manage to find it or not...
	RED():There is something you can learn from all this.
	LENA():What's that?
	RED():You are not as far from happiness as you think.
	RED():You are young, thoughtful, and curious.
	RED():Our world can often be the opposite of those things.
	RED():Not all the time, though.

	# Pause

	RED()[2]:My advice is that you channel that sense of adventure - the one that led you to the garden in the first place.
	RED():Keep searching. And I promise you, that somewhere...
	RED():Somewhere, you will find your garden.

# [Wishful Thinking]

/BLOCK=wishful
	RED():Oftentimes, when we face hardships in the present, we reminisce on the past.
	RED():My view is that this memory, real or not, brings you happiness and comfort at a particular time where you need it.
	LENA():I'm sorry, but that's not right. This has gone on much longer.
	LENA():Ever since I walked into that garden all those years ago...it's all I've thought about.
	LENA():Nothing else in the world comes close to it.
	LENA():It's all so...hollow.
	LENA():I have to find that garden again.

	# Pause

	RED()[2]:What if you don't?
	LENA():What?
	RED():Suppose, after many years, you cannot find that green door again.
	RED():What will you do then?

	# Pause

	LENA()[2]:I don't know.

	# Pause

	RED()[2]:Unfortunately, it is a realistic possibility.
	RED():If it comes to pass, you must find something else to fill the void left by your garden.
	RED():It will not be easy. It will take time.
	RED():But we find our ways to cope. To survive.
	RED():We can help you.

	# Pause

	LENA()[3]:I hope so.
