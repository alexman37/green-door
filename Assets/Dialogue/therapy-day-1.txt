	N():I can't remember how I found it.\nI guess, really, it found me.
	N():One day, I was wandering around town...\nDidn't know where I was going.\nDidn't want to know.
	N():I must have been looking for adventure.\nOr an escape.
	N():Suddenly, there it was.

	N():An immaculate green door, adorned with lush leaves and white roses.
	N():It was out of place in a town like this. It didn't belong.
	N():...I knew it was special.

	N():There was another world inside. A better world.
	N():A beautiful, serene garden...as pristine as you can imagine.
	N():A place where the setting sun always shines...
	N():Where the warm breeze puts your mind at ease...
	N():Where the golden plains and the gentle hills go on, and on, and on...
	N():The place of my dreams.
	N():I could have stayed there forever.

	LENA(crossed)[2]:That's what bothers me.

	# Pause

	RED(writing-lookup):Why does it bother you?
	LENA(crossed-2):I haven't been back since.
	LENA(bothered):I've tried looking for it.\nBy now, I must've searched every street in this town.
	LENA(nervous):And I'm still searching...

	# Pause

	RED(writing-lookup-2)[2]:Why is it important that you find the garden again?
	LENA(pensive-2):...
	LENA(pensive):You don't believe me.
	RED(grumpy2):That's not what I meant.
	LENA(look-away):No, I get it.\nI wouldn't believe me, either.
	LENA(look-away-2):This is all just...ridiculous, you know?

	# Pauses

	RED(folded-hands)[2]:Whether the garden is real or not, the experience has impacted you in some way.
	RED(folded-hands-2):You were willing to tell this story, knowing I likely wouldn't believe it.
	RED(default):That must mean something.

	# Pauses

	LENA(defeated)[3]:I've always had a hard time fitting in.
	LENA(defeated):Everything moves so fast.\nThere's always so much to do, in so little time.
	LENA(glance-2):But in that field, surrounded by endless nature...
	LENA(weak-smile):I felt like I had all the time in the world.

	# Pauses

	LENA(talking)[3]:What do you make of that?
	RED(normal-talking):You're asking me for a diagnosis?
	LENA(default):I guess so.
	RED(grumpy):I'm simply here to talk you through your feelings.
	RED(folded-hands):Only you can answer that question.\nIt would be unprofessional for me to judge you-
	LENA(glance-2):I'll allow it.
	RED(default):...

	# Pause

	LENA(look-away)[2]:Please...
	LENA(look-away-2):What do you think the garden means?

	RED(default):It sounds like a wonderful place.
	LENA(weak-smile):It was.
	LENA(bothered):I dream about it every night...

	# Pause

	LENA(pensive-2)[1]:Then I wake up here.

	# Pause

	RED(looking-off)[3]:Whether the garden is real or not...
	RED(looking-off-talking):Whether you manage to find it or not...
	RED(looking-off):There is something you can learn from all this.
	LENA():What's that?
	RED(default):You are not as far from happiness as you think.
	RED(normal-talking):You are young, thoughtful, and curious.
	RED(grumpy2):Our world can often be the opposite of those things.
	RED(default):Not all the time, though.

	# Pause

	RED(folded-hands)[2]:My advice is that you channel that sense of adventure - the one that led you to the garden in the first place.
	RED(folded-hands-2):Keep searching. And I promise you, that somewhere...
	RED(smiling):Somewhere, you will find your garden.

# [Wishful Thinking]

/BLOCK=wishful
	RED(looking-off):Oftentimes, when we face hardships in the present, we reminisce on the past.
	RED(looking-off-talking):My view is that this memory, real or not, brings you happiness and comfort at a particular time where you need it.
	LENA(bothered):I'm sorry, but that's not right. This has gone on much longer.
	LENA(crossed-2):Ever since I walked into that garden all those years ago...it's all I've thought about.
	LENA(crossed):Nothing else in the world comes close to it.
	LENA(bothered):It's all so...hollow.
	LENA(bothered):I have to find that garden again.

	# Pause

	RED(folded-hands)[2]:What if you don't?
	LENA(antsy):What?
	RED(default):Suppose, after many years, you cannot find that green door again.
	RED(normal-talking):What will you do then?

	# Pause

	LENA(defeated)[4]:...
	LENA(distraught):No idea.

	# Pause

	RED(pensive)[2]:Unfortunately, it is a realistic possibility.
	RED(default):If it comes to pass, you must find something else to fill the void left by your garden.
	RED(normal-talking):It will not be easy. It will take time.
	RED(folded-hands-2):But we find our ways to cope. To survive.
	RED(normal-talking):We can help you.

	# Pause

	LENA(defeated)[3]:I hope so.
