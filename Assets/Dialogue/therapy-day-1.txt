	N():I was young.
	N():I can't remember how I found it. I guess, really, it found me.
	N():One day, I was wandering around town...didn't know where I was going. Didn't want to know.
	N():I must have been looking for adventure, or an escape.
	N():Suddenly, there it was.

	N():An immaculate green door, adorned with lush leaves and white roses.
	N():Most people overlooked it. I couldn't understand why.
	N():I knew...I knew it was special.

	N():It's another world inside. A better world.
	N():A beautiful, serene garden...as pristine as you can imagine.
	N():A place where the setting sun always shines...
	N():Where the warm breeze puts your mind at ease...
	N():Where the flowery fields and the gentle hills go on, and on, and on...
	N():The place of my dreams.
	N():I could stay there forever.

	# Cut back to reality. We are in a formal, cozy-looking therapist's office. Dr. Red Wallace is an old and quaint man. Lena is a visually bright young woman, but her sadness contradicts that.

	LENA():That's what bothers me.

	# Pause

	RED():Why does it bother you?
	LENA():Because I haven't been back since.
	LENA():I've tried looking for it. By now I must've searched every street in this town.
	LENA():And I'm still searching...

	# Pause

	RED():Why is it important that you find the garden again?
	LENA():...
	LENA():You don't believe me.
	RED():That's not what I meant.
	LENA():No, I get it. I wouldn't believe me, either.
	LENA():This is all just...ridiculous, you know?

	# Pauses

	RED():Whether the garden is real or not, the experience has impacted you in some way.
	RED():You were willing to tell this story, knowing I likely wouldn't believe it.
	RED():That must mean something.

	# Pauses

	LENA():I've always had a hard time fitting in.
	LENA():Everything moves so fast. There's always so much to do, and so little time.
	LENA():But in that field, surrounded by endless nature...
	LENA():I had all the time in the world.

	# Pauses

	LENA():What do you make of all that?
	RED():You're asking me for a diagnosis?
	LENA():I guess so.
	RED():I'm simply here to talk you through your feelings.
	RED():Only you can answer that question. It would be unprofessional for me to judge you-
	LENA():I'll allow it.
	RED():...

	# Pause

	LENA():Please...
	LENA():What do you think the garden means?

# [Wonderful Place]

/BLOCK=wonderful
	RED():It sounds like a wonderful place.
	LENA():It was.
	LENA():I dream about it every night...

	# Pause

	LENA():Then wake up here.

	# Pause

	RED():Whether the garden is real or not...
	RED():Whether you manage to find it or not...
	RED():There is something you can learn from all this.
	LENA():What's that?
	RED():You are not as far from happiness as you think.
	RED():You are young, thoughtful, and curious.
	RED():Our world can often be the opposite of those things.
	RED():Not all the time, though.

	# Pause

	RED():My advice is that you channel that sense of adventure - the one that led you to the garden in the first place.
	RED():Keep searching. And I promise you, that somewhere...
	RED():Somewhere, you will find your garden.
	N():(Lena left, with something to look forward to.)

# [Wishful Thinking]

/BLOCK=wishful
	RED():Oftentimes, when we face hardships in the present, we reminisce on the past.
	RED():My view is that this memory, real or not, brings you happiness and comfort at a particular time where you need it.
	LENA():I'm sorry, but that's not right. This has gone on much longer.
	LENA():Ever since I walked into that garden all those years ago...it's all I've thought about.
	LENA():Nothing else in the world comes close to it.
	LENA():It's all so...hollow.
	LENA():I have to find that garden again.

	# Pause

	RED():What if you don't?
	LENA():What?
	RED():Suppose, after many years, you cannot find that green door again.
	RED():What will you do then?

	# Pause

	LENA():I don't know.

	# Pause

	RED():Unfortunately, it is a realistic possibility.
	RED():If it comes to pass, you must find something else to fill the void left by your garden.
	RED():It will not be easy. It will take time.
	RED():But we find our ways to cope. To survive.
	RED():We can help you.

	# Pause

	LENA():I hope so.

	# Fade to black

	N():(Lena left, unsure of what you said.)
