	N():\0The doctor reaches his hand out.\!
	RED(folded-hands)[3]:It's okay.
	RED(folded-hands-2):Breathe.


	# They breathe


	RED(looking-off)[3]:I am here to listen to your concerns, and talk you through them.
	RED(looking-off-talking):What brings you here today?

	# Pause

	LENA(glance)[3]:I've been thinking about, well, all of this. And the garden.
	LENA(glance-2):And then I realized something...
	LENA(look-away):I don't know what I'd do if I found it.

	# Pause

	LENA(bothered)[2]:I can't remember how, or why, I left in the first place.
	LENA(nervous):But I don't think it was my choice.
	LENA(defeated):If I remember one thing...it's wanting to be there forever.

	# Pause

	LENA(pensive)[2]:The world still moves so fast.
	LENA(pensive):Everyone feels so distant.
	LENA(pensive-2):I've tried to fix myself. I really have.
	LENA(sigh):But...


	# Pause


	LENA(antsy)[4]:What if I couldn't come back?
	LENA(antsy-2):What if I found that green door, and never had the chance to come back?
	LENA(look-away-2):...Would I never want to leave?

	RED(grumpy2):The advice I'm about to give is something no therapist would ever normally say.
	RED(default):Right now, I'm not speaking to you as a therapist.
	RED(down):I'm speaking as a fellow human being.
	RED(pensive):As a father.


	# Pause


	RED(folded-hands)[2]:I think your situation is special.
	RED(looking-off):If this garden is truly what you say it is...
	RED(looking-off-talking):I would understand if you kept going.
	RED(normal-talking):Even if it became your new home.

	# Pause

	RED(folded-hands-2)[2]:Humans aren't like other creatures.
	RED(down):We don't only need food, water and shelter to survive.
	RED(down-2):We also need a purpose.
	RED(down):You believe that society doesn't accept you. So you lack purpose.
	RED(looking-off):I see it another way.
	RED(down-2):Society could never understand you, because it doesn't deserve you.

	# Pause

	RED(normal-talking)[2]:It is your decision, but I will say this.
	RED(down):If there is something in this world that will miss you, that needs you...
	RED(default):That you deserve...

	# Pauses

	RED(smiling)[2]:It will find you, in your perfect garden.

	RED(normal-talking):Have you heard of the "Experience Machine"?
	LENA(defeated):No...
	RED(grumpy):It's a common thought experiment, known by many names.
	RED(adjust-glasses):It goes like this...

	# Pause

	RED(folded-hands)[3]:Suppose there was a machine that could make the user "experience" any emotion.
	RED(folded-hands-2):The world could be anything they imagined. They would feel whatever they desired.
	RED(folded-hands):To the user, it would be paradise - and reality.
	RED(down):But in our reality...they would forever be alone, locked in that machine.
	RED(default):Would you use such a machine?

	# Pause

	LENA(sigh)[3]:...
	LENA(bothered):I'm supposed to say â€˜no', aren't I?
	RED(grumpy2):There is no right or wrong answer.
	LENA(glance):But something tells me there is.
	RED(normal-talking):Are you worried you got it wrong?
	LENA(defeated):...

	# Pause

	RED(default)[2]:Then something is keeping you here.
	RED(looking-off):Perhaps you should give the question more thought.
	RED(looking-off-talking):So you'll be prepared...if you ever do find that machine.

	# Pause

	LENA(glance)[4]:...
	LENA(crossed):I don't think this is going to work.
	RED(normal-talking):I'm sorry?
	LENA(crossed-2):I don't want any more sessions.\nThanks for your time.
	RED(down):Lena, wait...

	RED(pensive)[2]:Please...don't go.
	RED(down-2):Let's keep talking about this.
	LENA(angry):Where's talking gotten us?
	LENA(angry-2):You keep giving me all these weird speeches and hypotheticals.
	LENA(angry-2):Trying to convince me I didn't see what I \iknow\! I saw.
	LENA(bothered):It's not exactly therapeutic.
	
	LENA(lookup-sad)[2]:...
	LENA(lookup-sad):No one believes me.\nWhy should they?
	LENA(glance-2):This has always been my own problem to solve.
	LENA(defeated):I'm finding that garden if it's the last thing I do.
	LENA(defeated)[2]:Goodbye.
